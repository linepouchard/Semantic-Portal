Earth Science represents a diverse and complex data and metadata ecosystem that includes satellite observations and remote sensing, observations, experimental results, model data, and more.  These data and accompanying metadata and descriptions are held in data centers that focus on types of data, such as ocean or ice data, hydrology data, climate model and simulation data.  In order to perform analyses of specific phenomena, for instance predicting flash floods or visualizing a major perturbation like a hurricane, scientists need to integrate multiple datasets with different parameters at various resolution levels from different sources.  In order to do this accurately, they need detailed descriptions and annotations of the chosen data sets, such as those provided by ontologies.  Ontologies provide machine-processable entities organized in a graph that can describe these datasets so that datasets are more discoverable.  Ontologies also provide labels and relationships between the entities so that ontology-annotated datasets can be discovered in multiple ways, by following relationships between entities, or by searching on related labels. <br>
Problems we are seeking to address include improving the discovery and reuse of ontologies as they in turn support discovery and reuse of datasets.  In Earth Science, most data and software are open source and available on the web.  What makes these ontologies hard to find is the sheer volume of data, metadata, and annotations available from numerous sources.  They often live on individual project web sites or in some cases in multi-purpose repositories such as Github.  Increasing availability helps improve quality through feedback and reuse.  <br>
